package Strings;
/* 
Given a string S of length n and q queries. In each query, You have to find out which character occur most of the time in a given range(L, R). If there are several answers, you have to find out the lexicographically smallest letter.
Input
The first line will contain two integers n, q (1 ≤ n ≤ 10**5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10**5), the length of the string and the number of queries respectively.
The next line contains the string S.
Next q lines will contain two integers L & R.
(1 ≤ n ≤ 10**5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10**5)
Output
For each query, find out the most occurrence character & the occurrence times. If there are several answers, you have to find out the lexicographically smallest character.
